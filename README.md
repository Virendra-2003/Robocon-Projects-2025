Perfect 👌 thanks for pointing that out. Since your **Design Details Document (VIIT Robotics 2025)** is specifically about a robotics project, the README should reflect the **mechanisms (Dribbling, Shooting, Kicking, etc.), technical design, and implementation details**—not just a generic template.

Here’s a **more technical README draft** tailored for your repo:

# 🤖 VIIT Robotics 2025 – RoboSoccer Design

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **design details, technical documentation, and implementation plan** for **VIIT Robotics 2025 RoboSoccer Bot**. The bot is designed to participate in robotics competitions with capabilities such as **ball dribbling, shooting, passing, and autonomous navigation**.

## ⚽ Key Mechanisms

* **Dribbling Mechanism** 🏃‍♂️

  * Controlled rollers to grip and guide the ball.
  * Powered by high-torque DC motors.
  * Designed for stable ball control during movement.

* **Shooting Mechanism** 🎯

  * Solenoid/Kicker system for powerful shots.
  * Adjustable force for short/long passes.
  * Triggered via motor control & solenoid driver circuits.

* **Ball Handling** 🏐

  * Angled plates and roller systems for smooth intake.
  * Supports real-time dribbling and precision control.

* **Chassis Design** 🔧

  * Lightweight aluminum/3D-printed frame.
  * Compact design for agility.
  * Mounting slots for mechanisms & sensors.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

* **Microcontroller**: \[e.g., STM32 / Arduino Mega / ESP32]
* **Motor Drivers**: \[e.g., L298N, Cytron MD30C, etc.]
* **Motors**: High RPM BLDC/DC geared motors.
* **Sensors**:

  * IR sensors for line detection.
  * Encoders for motor feedback.
  * IMU for stability & orientation.
* **Power Supply**: Li-Po battery (11.1V/22.2V) with BMS.
* **Communication**: Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / RF module.

## ⚙️ Software Stack

* **Programming Languages**: C++, Python.
* **Frameworks**: ROS (Robot Operating System), Arduino IDE, Embedded C.
* **Simulation Tools**: MATLAB / Gazebo / SolidWorks Motion Analysis.
* **Control System**: PID/MPU-based motion control for smooth navigation.
